# The MiniLaTex Project

The aim of the MiniLaTex project is to provide a way 
for authors to write mathematical text directly to the 
web.  That means being able to 

- live edit source text in one window, have the rendered text 
appear instantaneously in a companion window

- push a button to make the rendered text immediately available
to students and colleagues

- read MiniLaTeX documents on any device, from smartphone to
tablet to desktop computer

- push another button to convert a document to PDF, or to 
export a standard LaTeX file.

- search for MiniLaTeX documents by title, author, keyword,
full text, etc.


Accomplishing this requires a number of components:

- A parser, which reads MiniLaTeX source text and builds
an abstract syntax tree (AST)

- A renderer, which converts the AST to HTML.  

- An editor/viewer for authors

- A reader

- A system for storing documents, backing them up, and
providing a search engine.


## knode.io

A full editor/reader for MiniLaTeX is available at 
[knode.io](https://knode.io).  Here is a small selection of
documents that shows what it can do:

- [Notes on Quantum Field Theory](https://knode.io/424). Well, 
I need to finish these one day.  A start!

- [Notes on Physics](https://knode.io/977)

## Demos and Other Readers

- [MiniLaTeX Live](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/app/miniLatexLive/index.html) - 
A demo editor

- [MiniLaTeX Reader](https://knode.io/reader2/) - an app that 
can be configured inside a web page, displaying both MiniLaTeX
and other content.  The app can be set (for example) to 
display lecture notes for a given class.  No limit on the 
number of such pages one creates.


## Status and Plans

The project is still in an R&D-development phase, but in
eminently usable.  I use it for my own course notes, and
it has been used in several classes at Colorado State University.

I plan to make major improvements over the summer of 2019, and
I welcome suggestions, comments, and 
bug reports: jxxcarlson@gmail.com.
